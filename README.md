## Table of Contents

In this project, I utilized a combination of powerful tools to prepare, analyze, and visualize the UCI Heart Disease dataset. Below are the details of each program used:

### [MYSQL](#MYSQL)
   
**Purpose: Data Preparation**

Description: MySQL is a robust, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). For this project, I used MySQL to store the raw data, clean it, and perform preliminary transformations. SQL queries were employed to filter, aggregate, and join various tables, ensuring that the data was in the best shape for subsequent analysis.

### [RStudio](#RStudio)


**Purpose: Statistical Analysis**


Description: RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language focused on statistical computing and graphics. In this project, RStudio was used for Linear Regression and Clustering Analysis exploring patterns, trends and overall key findings from the data. Detailed statistical results and interpretations are presented in Page 2 of my dashboard.

### [Tableau](#Tableau)


**Purpose: Data Visualization**
  
Description: Tableau is a leading data visualization tool that helps in creating interactive and shareable dashboards. For this project, Tableau was used to create compelling visualizations that illustrate the key findings from the data analysis.
